# Folder-Clutter-Cleaner
This program uses the os module to clean up clutter inside a folder on your computer by renaming all the files with the specified file extension (e.g., png, jpg) to a numbered sequence (e.g., 1.png, 2.png, 3.png, etc.). It's a handy tool to quickly organize files in a directory.
